Next Steps for Genome Visualization

- have the coordinates be placed closer together to avoid intense direction and distance changes between them (think thread or spaghetti on a table)

- have bezier curves follow the main curve splines (look at more detailed bezier and curve functions to do this)

- function to draw/create a point on the line given any percentage (0-1)
